1-to-1 RTC: Sample App ReactJS, EnableX Web Toolkit

The Sample Web App demonstrates the use of APIs for EnableX platform to carry out 1-to-1 RTC (Real Time Communication). The main motivation behind this application is to demonstrate usage of APIs and allow developers to ramp up on app by hosting on their own devices instead of directly using servers.

RTC Applications hosted on EnableX platform run natively on supported set of web browsers without any additional plugin downloads.

This basic 1-to-1 Video Chat Application is developed using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.6, JAVA Script, jQuery, EnxRtc (The EnableX Web Toolkit).

> The details of the supported set of web browsers can be found here:

## 1. Important!

When developing a Client End Point Application, make sure to include the updated EnxRtc.js.

## 3 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## 5 Server API

EnableX Server API is a Rest API service meant to be called from Partners' Application Server to provision video enabled
meeting rooms. API Access is given to each Application through the assigned App ID and App Key. So, the App ID and App Key
are to be used as Username and Password respectively to pass as HTTP Basic Authentication header to access Server API.

For this application, the following Server API calls are used:

- https://developer.vcloudx.com/video-api/server-api/rooms-route/#get-rooms - To get list of Rooms
- https://developer.vcloudx.com/video-api/server-api/rooms-route/#get-room-info - To get information of the given Room
- https://developer.vcloudx.com/video-api/server-api/rooms-route/#create-token - To create Token for the given Room

## 6 Client API

Client End Point Application uses Web Toolkit EnxRtc.js to communicate with EnableX Servers to initiate and manage RTC Communications.
